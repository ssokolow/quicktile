Keyboard-driven Window Tiling for your existing X11 window manager

------------------------------------
Important Message For Existing Users
------------------------------------

As of QuickTile 0.3.0, the installation process has changed.

This was necessary to allow QuickTile to be split across multiple files so I
could get past some mental blocks and start to clean up the code and implement
new features.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------

* An X11-based desktop (The code expects NETWM hints and X11-style window decorations)
* Python 2.7
* PyGTK
* ``python-wnck``
* ``python-setuptools``
* ``python-xlib`` (optional, required for key-binding)
* ``dbus-python`` (optional, required for D-Bus service)

As PyGTK was never ported to Python 3.x and porting to GTK+ 3.x wouldn't bring
any significant benefits for a utility that is fundamentally incompatible with
Wayland's security model, these requirements are unlikely to change.

Depending on the distro you are using, you may be able to use one of the
following commands to easily install them:

**Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):**

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-xlib python-dbus python-wnck python-setuptools

**Fedora 22 and above:**

.. code:: sh

    sudo dnf install python pygtk2 pygobject2 dbus-python gnome-python2-libwnck

**Fedora 21 and below:**

.. code:: sh

    sudo yum install python pygtk2 pygobject2 dbus-python gnome-python2-libwnck

--------------------------
Installation (Typical Use)
--------------------------

After you have installed the above requirements (including ``python-xlib``)
via your system package manager, you can install QuickTile using either of the
following methods:

A. If you have ``pip2`` installed, just run this:

 .. code:: sh

     sudo pip2 install https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile/archive/master.zip

 **NOTE:** If you attempt to use the ``--upgrade`` option and it fails to
 properly ignore system-provided dependencies, just use these commands instead:

 .. code:: sh

     sudo pip2 uninstall quicktile
     sudo rm /usr/local/bin/quicktile /usr/local/bin/quicktile.py
     sudo pip2 install https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile/archive/master.zip

B. Without ``pip2``, download and unpack the zip file and run the following:

 .. code:: sh

     cd /path/to/local/copy
     ./install.sh

 Technically speaking, an ordinary ``sudo python2 setup.py install`` will also
 work, but ``install.sh`` has three advantages:

 1. It runs the ``setup.py build`` step without root privileges to avoid
    leaving root-owned cruft around.
 2. It will attempt to remove old QuickTile files which might cause a newer
    install to break.
 3. It saves you the trouble of setting QuickTile to run on startup.
    (``setup.py`` can't do this because it has no mechanism for adding files
    to ``/etc``.)

C. Without ``pip2``, if you don't want a system-wide install:

 1. Download and unpack the zip file.
 2. Copy the ``quicktile`` folder and the ``quicktile.sh`` script into a folder
    of your choice.
 3. Make sure ``quicktile.sh`` is marked executable.

 **NOTE:** If you'd rather roll your own, the ``quicktile.sh`` shell script is
 just three simple lines.

**AFTER INSTALLING:**

1. Run ``quicktile`` once to generate your configuration file

   **NOTE:** If the ``quicktile`` command dies with a
   ``No module named __main__`` error, you probably have an old
   ``quicktile.py`` file in ``/usr/local/bin`` that needs to be deleted. If
   that doesn't fix the problem, you should still be able to run QuickTile as
   ``python2 -m quicktile`` instead.
2. Edit ``~/.config/quicktile.cfg`` to customize your keybinds

   **Note:** Customizing the available window shapes currently requires editing
   the source code (though it's quite simple). This will be remedied when I
   have time to decide between extending the standard Python rcfile
   parser and replacing ``quicktile.cfg`` with ``quicktile.json``.
3. Set your desktop to run ``quicktile --daemonize`` if you didn't use
   ``install.sh``.


Important Notes:
================

* If you are running a desktop which uses Compiz (such as Unity),
  make sure you've used CCSM to disable the grid plugin or the fight between
  it and QuickTile for the same type of functionality may cause unpredictable
  problems.
* Some systems may not provide a Python 2.x binary under the name ``python2``.
  If this is the case on yours, ``install.sh`` must be edited if you choose
  to use it.
* You can list your current keybindings by running
  ``quicktile --show-bindings``
* You can get a list of valid actions for the configuration file by running
  ``quicktile --show-actions``

-------------------
Usage (Typical Use)
-------------------

1. Focus the window you want to tile
2. Hold the modifiers defined in ``ModMask`` (``Ctrl+Alt`` by default).
3. Repeatedly press one of the defined keybindings to cycle through window
   sizes available at the desired location on the screen.

The default keybindings are:

* ``1`` through ``9`` on the numeric keypad represent regions of your screen
* ``0`` on the numeric keypad will fully maximize the active window.
* ``H`` and ``V`` will maximize a window horizontally or vertically.
* ``Enter`` on the numeric keypad will cycle the active window to the next
  monitor.

This works best when combined with functionality your existing window manager
provides (eg. ``Alt+Tab``) to minimize the need to switch your hand between your
keyboard and your mouse.

Keybinding Syntax
=================

Both the ``ModMask`` field and the ``[keys]`` section use GTK+ accelerator
syntax and you can use modifier keys in both places. (``ModMask`` is prepended
to each ``[keys]`` value before parsing it.)

GTK+ modifier syntax looks like this::

    <Ctrl><Alt>Delete

The important things to keep in mind for using it are:

1. **Do not** put any spaces inside your keybind string.
2. Modifier names and non-modifier key names are not the same thing.
3. Modifier names are case-insensitive.
4. Key names like ``Down`` are case-sensitive. (Don't let the letter keys fool
   you. Those work the way they do because ``A`` and ``a`` are two separate
   names for the same key.)

Valid Key Names
---------------

GTK+ key names are just X11 key symbols so the simplest way to identify the
name for a key is to use the ``xev`` command. Just run it in a terminal and
press the key you want. It will print out something like this:

| KeyPress event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x8400001,
|    root 0x291, subw 0x0, time 2976251798, (149,-352), root:(192,460),
|    state 0x10, keycode 116 (keysym 0xff54, **Down**), same_screen YES,
|    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
|    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
|    XFilterEvent returns: False
|

The part I've bolded is the name QuickTile expects.

**Troubleshooting xev:**

* If nothing happens, make sure the ``xev`` window (and not the terminal) has
  focus.
* If pressing the key triggers some messages but you do not see one which says
  ``KeyPress event``, it's likely that some other program has already grabbed
  that key combination.

Also, in my testing, QuickTile currently fails to bind keys like ``Super_L``
(left Windows key) when they've been configured as modifiers. I'll look into
this as time permits.

Valid Modifier Names
--------------------

I haven't found a comprehensive document listing the modifier names
``gtk.accelerator_parse()`` accepts, but here are the names I'm aware of with
consistent mappings:

* Mappings that should be consistent across pretty much any system:

  * **Control:** ``<Control>``, ``<Ctrl>``, ``<Ctl>``, ``<Primary>``
  * **Shift:** ``<Shift>``, ``<Shft>``
  * **Alt:** ``<Alt>``, ``<Mod1>``
* Mappings which worked for me but I can't make any guarantees for:

  * **Windows Key:** ``<Mod4>``
  * **AltGr:** ``<Mod5>``
* Mappings which are possible but need to be manually set up using
  ``setxkbmap`` and ``xmodmap``:

  * ``<Mod3>`` (I redefined Caps Lock as ``Hyper_L`` and bound it to this)
* Modifiers which cause QuickTile to error out deep in ``python-xlib`` because
  GTK+ maps them to integers beyond the limits of the X11 wire protocol:

  * ``<Meta>``
  * ``<Super>``
  * ``<Hyper>``

-------------
Advanced Uses
-------------

* If you want to trigger QuickTile from another application in an efficient
  manner, make sure you have ``dbus-python`` installed and read up on how to
  send D-Bus messages using either your language's D-Bus bindings or the
  ``dbus-send`` or ``qdbus`` commands.
* If, for some reason, you want scripted tiling without D-Bus, you can also
  run commands like ``quicktile top-left`` but it may be slower as
  quicktile has to start, perform an action, and then quit every time you call
  it.

As with the built-in keybinding, requesting the same action more than once
in a row will cycle through the available window sizes. For further details,
see ``--help``.

----------
Known Bugs
----------

* libwnck tries to flood the logging output with
  ``Unhandled action type _OB_WM_ACTION_UNDECORATE\n\n`` messages, which is
  `a bug <https://icculus.org/pipermail/openbox/2009-January/006025.html>`_,
  and PyGTK doesn't expose the function needed to filter them away. As a
  result, the best QuickTile can do is pipe its output through grep, leaving a
  flood of blank lines since grep is finicky about matching them.
* ``pip2 uninstall`` doesn't remove the ``quicktile`` and/or ``quicktile.py``
  files from ``/usr/local/bin``, which can cause subsequent installs to
  break.

Thanks to Thomas Vander Stichele for some of the documentation cleanups.
