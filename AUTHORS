The Program
===========

QuickTile is primarily the work of Stephan Sokolow, however, it has
received various contributions over the years.

Thanks go out to the following people:

David Stygstra
   Generalized the "move-to-center" command into the "move-to-*"
   family of commands.

Fritz Reichwald
   Added "Gtk.init_check" in "quicktile.__main__" to work around a bug
   in some builds of GTK.

Gustavo J A M Carneiro and Filip Van Raemdonck
   Created the "gtkexcepthook" module in the form I started from.

Justin
   Added the "horizontal-maximize", "vertical-maximize", and "move-to-
   center" commands.

Matthias Putz
   Fixed use of an uninitialized variable in a difficult-to-trigger
   failure case.

Max Weiß

   * Added the "KEYLOOKUP" dict to compensate for un-intuitive
     omissions for the symbol names of common keys.

   * Reworked the shebang to address the period when some Linux
     distros lacked a **python2** binary while others linked
     **python** to Python 3.

Oliver Gerlich
   Corrected an omission on the list of dependencies for CentOS 7 and
   possibly other Red Hat-family distros.

Stéphane Gourichon

   * Researched how to create ".deb" packages

   * Wrote "recompile_local_debian_package.sh"

   * Set up the necessary package metadata for building a ".deb".

Stuart Axelbrooke
   Corrected a flaw in the window-tiling heuristics which prevented
   them from functioning correctly on especially large monitors.

Thomas Vander Stichele
   Helped to clean up the API documentation during the ePyDoc era.

Valdis Vitolins
   Added an omitted dependency on "python-setuptools" to "README.rst"

Valentin Agachi
   Corrected window-layout calculations to use "round()" for pixel
   values.

Yuting/Tim Xiao
   Made the window-tiling heuristics more robust.
