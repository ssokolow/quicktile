.. _monitor-*:

Multi-Monitor Operations
------------------------

.. note:: QuickTile for GTK+ 2.x used to preserve window positions within the
          limits of what the host window manager allowed, but it was discovered
          that, on a Kubuntu 16.04 LTS desktop consisting of both 1920x1024 and
          1280x1024 monitors, this could result in windows getting lost off the
          edge of the desktop.

          To avoid this, QuickTile for GTK 3.x clamps the position of the
          window to within the usable region of the target monitor.

          When further internal reworks make it possible, the intent is for
          QuickTile to remember the window's position on a per-monitor basis
          so that this position clamping is non-destructive to the user's
          desired layout.

          However, in the interim, please open a feature request on the issue
          tracker if you would make use of a configuration file option to
          disable this safety feature.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default Keybinding: :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`Keypad_Enter`

Workspace-wise Window Manipulation
----------------------------------

.. todo:: Decide whether to rework the ``workspace-send-*`` commands to *mean*

    so it's easy to dispatch a "send, then go" sequence from a single binding.

Miscellaneous Functionality
---------------------------

``show-desktop``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask the :abbr:`WM (Window Manager)` to toggle the visibility of all windows.

Be warned that some WMs will forget about this (it will degenerate into a

   :alt: diagram

``trigger-move``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask the :abbr:`WM (Window Manager)` to begin a "keyboard-driven move" operation
on the active window.

``trigger-resize``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask the :abbr:`WM (Window Manager)` to begin a "keyboard-driven resize"
