Usage
=====

QuickTile is built around a simple model of applying :doc:`tiling commands
<commands>` to either the active window or, for some commands, the
desktop as a whole.

.. todo:: I'm not satisfied with the style I've written ``usage.rst`` in. I'll
    need to come back to it later and try to puzzle out why.

These commands can be invoked in one of three ways:

Global Hotkeys
--------------

If QuickTile is started with the
`-\\-daemonize <cli.html#cmdoption-quicktile-d>`_ option, it will
attempt to bind global hotkeys as defined by the mappings in
:doc:`quicktile.cfg <config>`.

A typical use of QuickTile's hotkeys is as follows:

1. Focus the window you want to tile
2. Hold the modifiers defined in :ref:`ModMask <ModMask>` (:kbd:`Ctrl` +
   :kbd:`Alt` by default).
3. Repeatedly press one of the defined keybindings to cycle through window
   sizes available at the desired location on the screen.

This works best when combined with functionality your existing window manager
provides (eg. :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`Tab`) to minimize the need to switch your hand between your
keyboard and your mouse.

See the :doc:`commands` section for a listing of default keybindings and what
they do, or run ``quicktile --show-bindings`` and ``quicktile --show-actions``.

Command-Line Invocation
-----------------------

If QuickTile is started without ``--daemonize`` but with one or more positional
arguments, it will perform the specified sequence of actions on the active
window (or, depending on the command, on the desktop as a whole) and then exit.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ quicktile top-left top-left

This is useful for invoking QuickTile from incorporating it into shell scripts
or binding tiling commands to things `XGrabKey`_ can't see, such as
LIRC_-based remote controls via :manpage:`irexec(1)`.

If running this in a context where it is undesirable for your script to block
and display an error dialog on encountering an exception within QuickTile,
please pass `-\\-no-excepthook <cli.html#cmdoption-quicktile-no-excepthook>`_
when invoking QuickTile.

For more details on QuickTile's command-line interface, run ``quicktile
--help`` or see the :doc:`cli` section of this manual.

.. note:: Historically, most of the attention paid to QuickTile has been to
    its function under the influence of
    `-\\-daemonize <cli.html#cmdoption-quicktile-d>`_ and command-line
    invocation has known bugs in how it interacts with the X server.

    Most notably, when multiple commands are specified on a single
    command-line, it triggers a race condition where QuickTile doesn't properly
    wait for a command's effects to take hold before the next command begins
    querying window shapes.

    The simplest demonstration of this on a mulit-monitor system is
    ``quicktile monitor-next top-left`` which will cause the ``top-left`` to
    reverse the effect of the ``monitor-next``.

    A fix for this is intended, but the non-trivial re-architecting involved
    means that I don't want to do until after the automated test suite is
    sufficiently complete.

.. todo:: Fix the race conditions which prevent non-resident operation from
    functioning as expected.

D-Bus API
---------

Command-line invocation is useful but it *does* have a tendency to induce
a perceptible delay between pressing a key/button and having the window
respond.

If `dbus-python <https://pypi.org/project/dbus-python/>`_ is installed, the
`-\\-daemonize <cli.html#cmdoption-quicktile-d>`_ command-line option will also
attempt to claim the ``com.ssokolow.QuickTile`` service name.

It will expose a single object path (``/com/ssokolow/QuickTile``) with a single
interface (``com.ssokolow.QuickTile``) containing a single method
(``doCommand``) which can be used to call tiling commands as if invoked
by the global keybinding code.

A good way to test this out is using Qt's :command:`qdbus` command, which
serves as both a command-line D-Bus explorer and a client for calling D-Bus
methods.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ qdbus com.ssokolow.QuickTile
    /
    /com
    /com/ssokolow
    /com/ssokolow/QuickTile
    $ qdbus com.ssokolow.QuickTile /com/ssokolow/QuickTile
    method QString org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect()
    method bool com.ssokolow.QuickTile.doCommand(QString command)
    $ qdbus com.ssokolow.QuickTile /com/ssokolow/QuickTile \
        doCommand top-left
    true
    [terminal window is repositioned to the screen's top-left quarter]

The more ubiquitous ``dbus-send`` command can also be used to accomplish the
same thing, but it's much less convenient to work with and cannot double as
a D-Bus browser:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ dbus-send --type=method_call       \
        --dest=com.ssokolow.QuickTile    \
        /com/ssokolow/QuickTile          \
        com.ssokolow.QuickTile.doCommand \
        string:top-left

The :any:`bool` returned by ``doCommand`` indicates whether the given name
was found in the list of registered tiling commands.

Both of these commands can also be used as drop-in replacements for the
command-line interface as long as ``quicktile --daemonize`` has been started
beforehand.

Regardless of how you invoke the D-Bus interface, it has two advantages over
the command-line interface:

* :command:`qdbus` and :command:`dbus-send` start more quickly than QuickTile,
  so this is likely to have lower latency even if being invoked from a shell
  script rather than doing a direct D-Bus call from a resident process to
  QuickTile.
* Because it uses `-\\-daemonize <cli.html#cmdoption-quicktile-d>`_ to spin up
  a persistent event loop shared by the D-Bus and X server client libraries,
  the D-Bus interface is demonstrably free from all race conditions currently
  known to affect the command-line interface.
