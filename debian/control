Description: Keyboard-driven Window Tiling for your existing X11 window manager
 QuickTile is a simple utility, inspired by WinSplit Revolution for
 Windows, which adds window-tiling keybindings to your existing X11
 window manager.

 You can also think of it as a standalone alternative to the keyboard-
 related features of the Compiz Grid plugin.
